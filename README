Formation Flying Quadcopters
============================


This project is to take very cheap RC quadcopters (Cheerson CX10 used) and use a computer to remote control them with greater accuracy than a human could to allow formation flying and collaborative task completion.



Architecture
------------


USB Camera -> Convnet recognising quadcopters -> particle filter to get quadcopter state -> planning/control loop -> arduino proxy -> xn297 radio module -> quadcopters
